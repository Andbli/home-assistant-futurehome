/**
 * Represents a MQTT Event component for Home Assistant MQTT Discovery.
 *
 * The `mqtt` event platform allows you to process event info from an MQTT message. Events are signals that are emitted when something happens,
 * for example, when a user presses a physical button like a doorbell or when a button on a remote control is pressed.
 * With the event some event attributes can be sent to become available as an attribute on the entity.
 * MQTT events are stateless. For example, a doorbell does not have a state like being "on" or "off" but instead is momentarily pressed.
 *
 * For detailed documentation see:
 * https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/event.mqtt/
