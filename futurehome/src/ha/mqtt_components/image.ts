/**
 * Represents an MQTT Image component for Home Assistant MQTT Discovery.
 *
 * The `mqtt` image platform allows you to integrate the content of an image file sent through MQTT into Home Assistant as an image.
 * The `image` platform is a simplified version of the `camera` platform that only accepts images.
 * Every time a message under the `image_topic` in the configuration is received, the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated.
 * Messages received on `image_topic` should contain the full contents of an image file, e.g., a JPEG image, without any additional encoding or metadata.
 *
 * Alternatively, the `url_topic` option can be used to receive an image URL for a new picture to show.
 *
 * For detailed documentation see:
 * https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/image.mqtt/
